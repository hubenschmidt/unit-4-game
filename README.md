Project description: Build a simple game that adds to a score based on arbitary numbers assigned to images. Upon clicking the image, add to score total. The objective for the user is to match their score to the target number, by guessing the value of each of the four images they click.

This demonstrates basic command of jQuery, as well as an understanding of configure and reset functions.
